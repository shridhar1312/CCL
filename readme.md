Lambdas That Send the Notifications
ðŸ”¹ log_checker_lambda
Purpose:
Check CloudWatch Logs of all the Lambdas in LAMBDA_FUNCTIONS

Detect a specific error string

Categorize functions into:

With errors

Without errors

Send an SNS message with both lists

ðŸ”¹ notify_on_failure Lambda
This Lambda is not actually invoked by Step Functions directly, because:

It's not used in your CloudWatch Event Target (log_checker_lambda is used)

However, it's deployed and available, so maybe you plan to use it later?

Its logic:

Parses the Step Function execution history

Filters out failed Lambda tasks

Sends a detailed error report via SNS

You could make it part of the notification pipeline if you prefer analyzing Step Function history over raw CloudWatch logs.
